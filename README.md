# Project Concepts
A place for experimenting with Python code, data analytics and cad designs.
It is going to be a weekly updated with new material.

## Project 1: 
Calculating the ideal angle that the solar panels have to be placed, compared to the horizon. 
* Part 1: Solar tracker (16/12/2020)
* Part 2: Double integration over every minute of a given year and for every given angle of solar panels compared to the horizon. (~21/12/2020)

## Project 2:
A project of electric or gas furnace which melts aluminium waste and creates aluminium ingots.
The waste heat of the furnace is concequently used to heat a water boiler, for bath or other hot water uses.
In that way the problem of Wednesday (or your waste collection date), is basically solved as instead of plastic waste, small aluminium ingots are created with way smaller volume.
So in utopic world where everything that is sold in a supermarket is made with cardboard, glass or aluminium, the waste collection would be way simpler, and concepts as ultra high density buildings for students halls or residences in places like Tokyo, could be made.
* Part 1: A forgotten OpenScad file of a boiler from some of my early CAD adventures.(16/12/2020)
* Part 2: Feasibility study by using chemistry and simple thermodynamics.(~28/12/2020)
* Part 2: Recreation on FreeCad.(~4/12/2020)

## Project 3:
A Python project for creating an automatic cat feeder based on Rasberry Pi.(~11/12/2020)
