    "This furnace would have two limits: One would be its surface area as due to boltzmann law it has to be minimized so its volume would have to be around a litre (1L) unless, special silver polished coatings would be used to decrease the emissivity. The second would be the need to have high peek power around a 5 KW to reach temperature fast and melt the aluminium. At less than 2.5 kw without coating it would be impossible to work.\n",
